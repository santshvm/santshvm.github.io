        <h2>2005-2008</h2>

<p>I decided to major in Computer Science when I was in high school. I was first introducted to computers back in 2005 when I was in kindergarten under a program that aimed at making kids familiar with using a computer where demonstrations were held to help kids understand how to turn on/off a computer and using input devices like mouse and keyboard. I clearly remember playing computer games that were popular those days on a Wipro PC that ran on Windows 98 OS and had a all white setup - a white classic mechanical keyboard, a hefty white CRT monitor, a huge white CPU and a ball mouse that would occasionally stop working and require cleaning. As a Gen Z kid I got obsessed with playing games like Road Rash, Project I.G.I, Need For Speed and other popular video games on my cousin’s computer since we didn’t have a PC at home. Back in early 2000s PCs were supposed to be one of the most valuable possessions as they were very expensive in India which is why PCs were mostly used in offices. I got my first PC back in 2008 when I was in grade 2 which was a locally assembled low-end PC with relatively weak hardware and performance. I would spend hours playing games on that PC and experimenting with the application softwares like MS Paint, MS Office etc that came pre-installed on that PC that didn’t require an internet connection.</p>
 <h2>2011-2019</h2>
<p>I was first introduced to programming in 2011 when I was in grade 5. We were taught how to program in GWBasic(Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code). We wrote simple programs like printing strings to the terminal, storing data in variables, performing arithmetic operations on numbers etc… In my high school computer lab, me and my friends would compete with each other to see who could code faster and error free. Since then, I became passionate about programming. At high school I learned other programming languages like C++ in grade 8 and Java in grade 9 and 10.
    Since I enjoyed programming so much, I decided to major in Computer Science.

<h2>2020-2022</h2>
   <p>
    In 2020, I entered college as Computer Science and Engineering major. In my freshmen year I got introduced to C programming language and data structures like arrays and some basic algorithms like searching and sorting in arrays. In my sophomore year I learned about data structures and object oriented programming (with C++) in-depth. Apart from programming, I took some systems and theory courses like Operating Systems, Database Management System, Computer Architecture and Organisation, Automata and Formal Languages. I started web application development in my sophomore year and I continue to learn different full stack web development frameworks. In my free time I build different web application development projects that helps me in strengthening my skills in web development and escaping the tutorial hell. Recently, I developed an interest in Big Data Analytics and I aim to dive deep into Big Data Analytics.
